Requirements.txt contains library numPy, used to perform certain mathematic operations. If you do not have the library numPy, the python code will automatically import it for you, but the code I have written does not actually require numPy To run this script from the command line, I reccomend downloading the github CLI for ease and assurance that you are actually downloading things to the right place. After that, click the green "code" button on the repository homepage, click the GitHub CLI tab, and copy the path. Paste this path into the command line, and the script will be on its way to your computer. Remember to look for the folder marked "cot-4500-as1". To run the script from the command line, go into this folder, open main, and select "assignment_1.py" Click "copy path" and paste that into your command line. Make sure the path to your python application is accessible via the command line, otherwise it will not run.
