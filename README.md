Requirements.txt contains library numPy, used to perform certain mathematic operations. It will run at version 1.24.2, the latest version. To run this script from the command line, I recommend downloading the github CLI for ease and assurance that you are actually downloading things to the right place, but running straight from your computer's CMD also works. After that, click the green "code" button on the repository homepage, click the GitHub CLI tab, and copy the path. Paste this path into the command line, and the script will be on its way to your computer. Remember to look for the folder marked "cot-4500-as1". Now, open the folder, go to "requirements.txt", and copy that path before going into the command line and entering "pip install -r (paste path here).  To run the script from the command line, go into this folder, open main, and select "assignment_1.py" Click "copy path" and paste that into your command line. Make sure the path to your python application is accessible via the command line, otherwise it will not run.
